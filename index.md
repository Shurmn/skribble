## Background

#### Scribe
Purchased as a nestling by a mage's guild for 100 gp, Skribble was trained to copy all manner of writings, but not to read them. Involuntarily employed as the guild's scribe, he was effectively held captive in the library throughout childhood. Guild magic and manipulation ensured his subservience.

In spring of his seventeenth year, the guild archaeologists returned from a distant expedition with an ancient, powerful book. Attempts to decipher it ended tragically, as readers became stricken with an ineffable madness. Deemed expendable following the gruesome death of the archmage, Skribble was tasked with copying the cursed book.

Though he could not read the runes he feverishly wrote, flickers and hints of meaning nonetheless began to invade his perception and memory. Slowly at first, he began to imagine psychic whispers promising a path to freedom, as he sat copying gibberish for days without end. In the night of the 13th day, in a state between dream and delirium, Skribble spoke a reply into the void. His mind awakened, and Skribble became suffused with the alien magic of a slumbering Old God from beyond the far realms.

The psychic wake of this cosmic passing crashed over the library and spilled out into the surrounding reality, warping the very minds of the mages. Bloody pandemonium ensued throughout the guild campus as violent insanity gripped the scholars and staff. By daybreak, Skribble stood among the smoldering ruins, sole survivor of the only home he had ever known.

Bearing only the book and his favorite pen, newly free yet subconciously guided by whispers from beyond perception, Skribble ventured out into the world.

#### Background Features
**Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, History

**Researcher**: When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

## Warlock Class Features

**Skill Proficiencies:** Intimidation, Investigation, Light Armor, Simple Weapons

#### Patron: Great Old One
**Awakened Mind** - Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

#### Pact of the Tome
Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

#### Eldritch Invocations
**Book of Ancient Secrets**

Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature

You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag. On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

**Mask of Many Faces**

You can cast disguise self at will, without expending a spell slot.
