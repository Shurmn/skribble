## Warlock Class Features

**Skill Proficiencies:** Intimidation, Investigation, Light Armor, Simple Weapons

#### Patron Features: Great Old One
**Awakened Mind**: Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

**Entropic Ward**: At 6th level, when a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Pact of the Tome
Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

#### Eldritch Invocations

**Agonizing Blast:** When you cast Eldritch Blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.

**Book of Ancient Secrets:** You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag. On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

**Mask of Many Faces:** You can cast disguise self at will, without expending a spell slot.

## Kenku Race Features
A race of crow-like, wingless Avians that communicate through their ability to flawlessly imitate any sound they hear. These flightless people often form thieves guilds, referred to as "flocks" in major cities and quite often work as burglars, pickpockets, and assassins.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Forgery Kit, Stealth 

**Ability Score Increase:** Dexterity +2 and Wisdom +1

**Expert Forgery:** You can duplicate other creatures' handwriting and craftwork. You have advantage on all checks made to produce forgeries or duplicates of existing objects.

**Mimicry:** You can mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception) check.

## Background

#### Background Features
**Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, History

**Researcher:** When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

#### Origin: Mage's Guild Scribe
Purchased as a nestling by a mage's guild for 100 gp, Skribble was trained to copy all manner of writings, but not to read them. Involuntarily employed as the guild's scribe, he was effectively held captive in the library throughout childhood. Guild magic and manipulation ensured his subservience.

In spring of his seventeenth year, the guild archaeologists returned from a distant expedition with an ancient, powerful book. Attempts to decipher it ended tragically, as readers became stricken with an ineffable madness. Deemed expendable following the gruesome death of the archmage, Skribble was tasked with copying the cursed book.

Though he could not read the runes he feverishly wrote, flickers and hints of meaning nonetheless began to invade his perception and memory. Slowly at first, he began to imagine whispers coming from the shadows promising a path to freedom, as he sat copying gibberish for days without end. In the night of the 13th day, in a state between dream and delirium, Skribble spoke a wordless reply into the y̔̓̒̑̆̚aͬͩͬ̓wͩͬ̽̂̒̔ͨņͫi̢̊ͮ͗̅ͪ̐n̿̅͗̔͑̅g̴ͧ̈́ͪ͂ ̵̑̓̓vͪ͌͒͒ͣ͜oͭ̓̀҉i̔d̍̑. His mind awakened, and Skribble became suffused with the alien magic of a slumbering O̘͖ͯ͋̀ḷ̓ͮͩd͚͚̮̣̞̠̯͌͋ͧ͠ ͭ̂̆̋͋G͚̞̝̭̖̬̅̈̐͛̈o͇̪͓͊̓͆ͫ̆d̀̊ͨͮ͡ from beyond the far realms.

The p̨śỳ͟͢c̛h͢͝͠i͡c̀ ̸͡wa̧̢̧k̵̵͢e͟͜ of this cosmic passing crashed over the library and spilled out into the surrounding reality, warping the very minds of the mages. Bloody pandemonium ensued throughout the guild campus as violent insanity gripped the scholars and staff. By daybreak, Skribble stood among the smoldering ruins, sole survivor of the only home he had ever known.

Bearing only the book and his favorite pen, a gleefully free Skribble ventured out into the world, subconciously guided by eldritch murmurings from beyond mortal perception.

#### Career Adventurer
In a obsessive (but perhaps, somewhat meandering) search for knowledge of the O̴̜͔̥̭̙ͣ̂̂̀͜l̻̩̿̈ͫ̔ͧ̆͌ͩḑ̢̫̫ͥ̉̌ͮ̅ͪ̕ ̟͎͕̐͐̈́̿͐̔ͤ̀́͜G̢̢͖̝̖͍͇̰͖̜͗ͤ͌͢o̩̘͇̬ͩ͋́d̯̗̱̮̦̩͓̅̏̏ͫ̎̓ H̵͕͓̦̝͖̙̘̆̀͐́̏̓̔̑͐̇̒̾̾A̵̙̘̗̭̮̤̰̲̲̖̝͖͍͍̭͍̮̲̩͇͎͎͈͚̬̘̲̅͒̅̒̆̿̃͒̌͆̇S̶̪̞̺̟̗̥̘͙̆͆͂̉̍̀̿̑̒̀̈́͊͋͆̂̈́́̄̚͝͝͠͝T̷̨̡̲̯̟̙̳̫̳̜̹̗̤̍̔̓̇̓̈́͗̈́͐͌̽̕ͅƯ̴̧̧̧̡̟͇̙͕͔̗͚͈̪͔̮̭̳̣̠̮̣͉̭͓̅͒̽̓̀͑̉̓͌̔͛͑̂͐̏̅́̓̾̓͌̆͂̄̕ͅR̸̡̢̻̜̯͙̟̜̠̻̥͉̞͔̩͈͈̯̞̪͎̫͓̻̺̺̪̄̽̽̈́͂͐̓̄̅̄̌̾̋̃̚͜, Skribble scoured the world for its innermost secrets, delving into increasingly risky places and bargains.

While undertaking some contractual marital ambuscade, Skribble attached himself to a party of adventurers based out of the small mining town of Phandalin. This party was later responsible for triggering the now infamous necromantic surge at Shimmerwind, ushering in a cataclysm that would grow to plague the entire region.

A pattern was forming.
